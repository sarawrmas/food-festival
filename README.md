## Usage
The home page presents with an interactive image carousel describing the event and prompting the user to see more of the website.

Under the carousel, you can read testimonials, our mission statement, and see our rating.

The footer contains links to our social media pages. Follow us on facebook, twitter, google, instagram, and pinterest.

The navigation contains a link to the weekend's schedule, which gives a detailed overview of the events for each day with a short description.

The tickets link in the navigation shows a table of ticket prices and allows you to purchase your tickets. Select the "Purchase Tickets" button and modal will pop up. You can select how many days you'd like to attend, how many passes you want, and an email address. After hitting purchase, you will see a notification that an email will be sent to you with a complete order form.

At any time, you can click either "Home" or the title "Food Festival" in the navigation menu to return home.
